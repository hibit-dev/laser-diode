# Interfacing laser diode module with Arduino
Laser modules emit highly focused beams of light, making them ideal for a wide range of applications. One of the key aspects of a laser module is its power output, typically measured in milliwatts (mW). Arduino compatible laser modules typically have a power output within the lower range ensuring safety and compatibility with the microcontroller board. It's important to note that modules require safety precautions due to their increased risk of eye damage and potential fire hazards for higher-power lasers.
